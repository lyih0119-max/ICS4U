### Project 1: Kevin Fans
- **What it does:** A small interactive mini project where users click to gain points (“fans”) and unlock upgrades.
- **What it shows / solves:** It demonstrates basic game logic (points, upgrades, progression) and real-time UI updates.
- **Target user:** Anyone who wants a simple, fun clicker-style mini game.
- **What I would improve next:** Add sound effects/animations, add save/load, and improve the UI design.
